# JPACRUDProject
## Description
This Project is a web based application that retrieves and displays Dog Park data. It allows the user to choose actions and submit query data. The user is presented with a menu and is given the option to search dog parks via its numeric ID. Based on the user input, if a dog park is found, its ID, address, city, state, and the park size in acres are displayed. The address is a hyperlink that queries Google Maps based on the address and city and returns a detailed location of the dog park. Users are given the option to add or delete dog parks from the database along with the option to edit existing parks. When editing existing dog parks all form fields are auto populated with the existing dog park database information. If no parks are found, they see a message saying so and are prompted to try again. Menu options at the top of each page allow the user to navigate to the home page or view a list of all available dog parks in the database.
